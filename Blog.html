                <h2>Something About Plastic Free Society</h2>

                <p><b> 1. INTRODUCTION TO PLASTIC POLLUTION :</b>
                <br><br>
                In the last decade, plastic has affected the health and life of human beings very badly. 
                Some incidents have attracted the attention of the whole world and put a question mark 
                about the use of plastic in daily life.
                <br><br>

                Plastic, the wonder material that we use for everything and which pollutes our environment, 
                is perhaps the most harmful of trash dumped by mariners and sea-goers in sea because it does 
                not readily break down in nature. In-fact, the plastic that goes over the side today may 
                still be around in hundreds of years to foul up the fishing gear, boat propellers, and 
                beaches of future generations.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b> 2. CAUSES OF PLASTIC POLLUTION :</b>
                <br><br>
                Plastics are used because these are easy and cheap to make and they can last a long time. 
                Unfortunately these very useful qualities make plastic a huge pollution problem. 
                Because the plastic is cheap it gets discarded easily and its persistence in the environment 
                can do great harm. Unbanization has added to the plastic pollution in concentrated form in cities.

                Plastic thrown on land can enter the drainage lines and choke them resulting into floods 
                in local areas in cities as was experienced in Mumbai, India in 1998. It was claimed 
                in one of the programmes on TV channel that eating plastic bags results in death of 
                100 cattle per day in U.P. in India.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b> 3. EFFECTS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION</b>
                <br><br>
                Since the development of plastic earlier this century, it has become a popular material used 
                in a wide variety of ways. Today plastic is used to make, or wrap around, many of the items 
                we buy or use. The problem arises when we no longer want these items and we have to dispose 
                off them, particularly the throwaway plastic material used in wrapping or packaging.
                <br><br>
                Plastics are used because they are easy and cheap to make and they can last a long time. 
                Unfortunately these same useful qualities can make plastic a huge pollution problem. 
                The cheapness means plastic gets discarded easily and its long life means it survives 
                in the environment for long periods where it can do great harm.
                <br><br>
                The plastic rubbish found on beaches near urban areas tends to originate from use on land, 
                such as packaging material used to wrap around other goods. On remote rural beaches the 
                rubbish tends to have come from ships, such as fishing equipment used in the fishing industry.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b> 4. CONTROL OF PLASTIC POLLUTION</b>
                <br><br>
                Plastic bags and bottles, like all forms of plastic, create significant environmental and economic 
                burden. They consume growing amount of energy and other natural resources, degrading the 
                environment in a number of ways.
                <br><br>
                In addition to using up fossil fuels and other resources, plastic products create litter, 
                hurt marine life, and threaten the basis of life on earth. Here are some steps that we can 
                take to reverse the tide of toxic, non-biodegradable pollution so that it may not overtake our planet.
